 "content": "A Computer Network is a system of connected computers, peripherals and communication devices that can exchange data and share resources. If the network is limited to a single building or group of buildings then it is described as a Local Area Network (LAN). Computers in a LAN can be linked together directly but more commonly are linked through a hub or switch. The network connections can be cable, fiber-optic, or wireless (infra-red, microwave or radio). A router acts as an interface between networks, passing data packets back and forth between them.",
